### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**mgomezo12/mgomezo12** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am in my to become a hydrogeologist, currently doing a mater in Groundwater and Global Change, passionate about data analyses and groundwater modelling. I have a geological engeneering background, therefore, field work and data colletion is also a part of me. 

Python is the coding language that I have used the most so far, but I can read and work on Java script, Matlab, R and trying to incorporate Julia. 
I started to upload my codes not so long ago but I have around 5 years of experience coding for geosciences applications. 



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning applications to forecast groundwater levels.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning FloPy, Tensorflow and advanced geopandas.
- ðŸ’¬ My main interest: integrate data science and hydrogeology. Working towards making groundwater visible!.
- ðŸ˜„ Let me help you in case you need it.
- âš¡ I believe open source is a key to development. Inclusion is essential.
- ðŸ“« Send me a message here if you have any questions or to mgomezo1212@gmail.com!
