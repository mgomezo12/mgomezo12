### Hi there 👋

I am on my way to become a hydrogeologist, currently doing a master in Groundwater and Global Change, passionate about data analyses and groundwater modelling. I have a geological engeneering background, therefore, field work and data colletion is also a part of me. 

Python is the coding language that I have used the most so far, but I can read and work on Java script, Matlab, R and trying to incorporate Julia. 
I started to upload my codes not so long ago but I have around 4 years of experience coding for geosciences applications. 



- 🔭 I’m currently working on machine learning applications to forecast groundwater levels.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FloPy, Tensorflow and advanced geopandas.
- 💬 My main interest: integrate data science and hydrogeology. Working towards making groundwater visible!.
- 😄 Let me help you in case you need it.
- ⚡ I believe open source is a key to development. Inclusion is essential.
